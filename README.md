# HTML/CSS Experimental Webpage

This is an experimental webpage showcasing various CSS features created by Felix P. The page consists of a number of square boxes arranged in rows and columns. The boxes contain different elements such as text, images, links, and videos. Some boxes are hidden and only appear when certain events occur such as hovering over or clicking on a box.

## Installation

To use the page, simply download all the files and open up index.html in your browser. The page will load and you can start interacting with the different elements on the page.

## Usage

The page is intended as an experimental page and features various cool elements for the user to interact with. There is also a slider that allows the user to adjust the colors of the page according to their preference.
